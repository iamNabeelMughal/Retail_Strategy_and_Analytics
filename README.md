Optimizing Chip Sales Through Customer Segment Analysis &amp; Store Layout Trials

# Problem:
The supermarket's chip section is a profitable segment, and there is potential to boost its revenue further by understanding customer purchasing behavior and optimizing store layouts. The Category Manager for Chips aims to glean insights into different customer segments and their purchasing habits, and additionally, test the effectiveness of trial store layouts to enhance sales.

# Objective:
To deliver actionable insights into which customer segments are most profitable and suggest recommendations based on their purchasing behavior. Furthermore, assess the success of trial store layouts and recommend whether they should be rolled out to all supermarket locations.

# Solution:
# Task 1: Customer Segmentation and Purchase Behavior:

Conducted a thorough analysis of transaction and customer data, ensuring data integrity by cleaning and merging datasets.
Identified customer segments and analyzed their chip purchasing trends.

# Key Findings:

The top three segments leading in total sales are:
Budget older families
Mainstream young singles/couples
Mainstream retirees
Mainstream young singles/couples spend more per transaction, with a notable preference for Tyrells chips and a 32% higher tendency for 270g Twisties chips. In contrast, they are 50% less inclined towards 220g Burger Rings chips.

# Recommendation:

Strategically position popular products like Tyrells and 270g Twisties chips to cater to the mainstream young singles/couples segment. Leveraging the universal appeal of Kettles chips, positioning the mentioned brands nearby could further boost sales.

# Task 2: Impact of New Trial Layouts:

Selected control stores based on specific metrics and compared their performance against the trial stores (77, 86, and 88) in terms of sales revenue, customer count, and average transactions per customer.

# Key Findings:

Store 77 and 86 experienced a significant surge in customer counts during the trial period.
For store 77, even though customer count increased, the total sales didn't show a commensurate rise, indicating potential promotional activities affecting the price.
Store 88's performance during the trial period wasn't significantly different from its control phase.

# Recommendation:

The trial layouts led to an increase in customer counts for stores 77 and 86. However, store 88's performance was relatively unchanged, suggesting potential variations in its trial approach. It's advised to explore further into store 88's strategies during the trial period and consider rolling out the new layout for stores resembling the demographics of 77 and 86.
